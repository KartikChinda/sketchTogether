## SKETCH TOGETHER
Welcome to SketchTogether, an app for which I will be finding a catchy subtext line later, probably never. But the product's cool. Fire 'er up here: 

Steps: 

1. Create the components folder that has three major playgrounds, your menu, your toolbox, and your board. 

2. Creating the menu drawer is the easiest, it is essentially a hanging div with some react icons. Done using Tailwind, and React Icons.
